<!--At minimum, you must use at least all of the following HTML tags on your recipe web page: section, p, h1, h2, h3, ul, li, strong, em, img

Your recipe should have at least 3 sections:

Photo: No body wants to follow a recipe without some photos. You should have at least three. Maybe one per recipe instruction? Up to you.
Ingredients list: try and be creative with the formatting in this section
Directions
Keep it simple at first, focusing more on HTML structure and less on CSS styling.

Once you have a nice semantic HTML page, go ahead and style with CSS. Do your best to organize your CSS and markup based on SMACSS.

You can style however you like, but make sure you include at least one instance of each of these effects:

1. Image styling

Use CSS3 styles to add rounded or circular border around the images.
Add a drop shadow.
Maybe crop the photos using only CSS3.
Be creative and play around with the settings in Chrome before applying them to your CSS (for speed).
2. Styling change on hover

Apply a hover effect to some aspect of the recipe site so that when someone hovers, it rotates/tilts, grows, changes border colour, etc or a combination of that.
Use of CSS3 transforms is encouraged.
Transition the effect so that the transformation is not sudden.
Tips:

Use Sublime Text to create a recipe.html and style.css file somewhere on your computer
Open the file in Google Chrome instead of another browser
Use Chrome DevTools to quickly experiment with changes / fixes to your source code
When making changes to the source code, Save the source code in sublime before switching back to Chrome
Remember where you saved and don't delete recipe.html, you will be using it later. -->
